# Study Note: Stack

## Description
- A linear data structure that operates on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) or First-In-Last-Out (FILO) principle.
- Elements are added and removed from the same end, referred to as the "top."
- Similar to a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top.
- Common operations:
    - **Push**: Add an element to the top.
    - **Pop**: Remove the top element.
